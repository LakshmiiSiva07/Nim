Playing NIM game vs AI
The game of NIM is simulated and the user can make his move by specifying which pile they would take and no of sticks they would remove. The computer generates an action using alpha beta pruning technique.
The user input at the beginning ,is the first player who has to make a move "Computer" or "User".
The game proceeds, with user and computer alternating each other and final state is reached.
It is to be noted that the computer not always wins when the player plays rationally though it tries its best to win the game
